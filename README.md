A driver to interact with general-purpose input-output pins on an STM32F767

# Installation
 
1. Clone the repository by doing ```git clone https://github.com/rohanperi/GPIO-Driver.git``` in your terminal.
2. Make sure you have Keil µVision® IDE: hhttps://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/
3. Have your Microcontroller (MCU) ready, I used an STM32F767 but other MCUs from ST can work too!
4. Open this project in Keil µVision®, making sure your MCU is connected to your PC, then build and run the code

# Usage

Once the code is run, the on-board LED should be blinking! Feel free to edit the code and use this driver for any other GPIO of choice!
